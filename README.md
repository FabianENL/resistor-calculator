# resistor-calculator

- Read the resistor from left to right with the small gap on the right. 
- Click the arrows untill the colors match the colors on the resistor.
- When using a 6 band resistor, ignore the last band on the resistor. This is the temperature coefficient. This can be ignored.
- When using a 3 or 4 band resistor, leave band 1 on the calculator on black and start from band 2 of the calculator. If you are using a 3 band resistor the tolerance rating isn't correct.
